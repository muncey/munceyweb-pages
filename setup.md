ðŸš€ Angular CLI Project Setup GuideThis guide details how to transition the single-file Angular application into a standard Angular CLI workspace.

Step 1: Initialize the ProjectFirst, ensure you have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed.Install the Angular CLI (if needed):npm install -g @angular/cli
Create a New Angular Project: We will use the --standalone flag, as the provided code uses standalone components.ng new modern-portfolio --standalone --style css --skip-tests
cd modern-portfolio
Install Dependencies: The app uses Chart.js for the performance graph.npm install chart.js
Step 2: Transfer Styles (styles.css)Copy the entire contents of the global <style> tag from the original index.html file into the main CSS file for the project.File Location: src/styles.css (or src/styles.scss if you chose SCSS)Content to Copy:(You can find the full CSS block in the file below.)Step 3: Create and Update Component FilesThe single TypeScript class and embedded HTML template need to be separated into their own files.3.1. app.component.ts (Logic)This file contains the component logic, state signals, and the initializeChart method. You must replace the in-browser compilation syntax (const core = ng.core;, etc.) with standard TypeScript imports.File Location: src/app/app.component.ts3.2. app.component.html (Template)This file contains the user interface. You must convert the template from the internal Angular renderer syntax (App.ÉµngContentSelect, etc.) back into standard Angular structural directives (@for, @if, [class]).File Location: src/app/app.component.htmlStep 4: Run the ApplicationOnce the files are correctly placed, you can start the development server.ng serve --open
The application will now run on http://localhost:4200/ (or similar), compiled by the Angular build system!
